This script provides custom controls for AKAI APC Keys 25 in Ableton DAW
With this custom controls you can:

New Shortcuts for APC 25 (Edited by Dmitry Lozinsky): 
Clip buttons:
one press - 		Record Clip
second press -		Play Clip
double press -		Delete Clip
Press on playing - 	Stop Clip
Shift+StopAllClips+ClipBut - Delete Clip
Shift+Select - 		Undo
Shift+ClipStop -	Metronome on/off
Rec -			Record Clip
Shift+Rec -		Record Session

for controls used APC 25 keys (clipStop, Select), so if you need default functions of this buttons - you willbe upset.
personally for me this setup is very good for live sessions

Installation:
for install replace the files in folder "c:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 10 Suite\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\APC_Key_25" by files from this repository
for Ableton 11 target path is c:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 11 Suite\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\APC_Key_25
(Don't forget save your original files)

There are two versions of script:
1. 3 rows for scenes, one row for solo and last one for mute buttons
2. 5 rows for scenes without mute/solo buttons as well as in the original version from Akai
By default, the first version will work. If you need the second (5 scenes) - rename the file APC_Key_25.py from repository to new name like APC_Key_25_3row.py and then rename APC_Key_25_5rows.py to APC_Key_25.py

Tested for Ableton 9 and 10

Version for Ableton 11 is available. Look at the release for Ableton 11 in this page
